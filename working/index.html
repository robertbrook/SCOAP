  <h1>Joint Enterprise - Justice Committee</h1>
  
  
  <strong>Examination of Witness (Questions 1-39)</strong>
  


  <p>


<strong>Chair</strong> 

Welcome, Mr Starmer. We are glad to have you with us this morning to discuss mainly joint enterprise, although there is one other question to which I will refer in a moment when we have declared interests where necessary.</p>

  <p><strong>Mr Buckland</strong> I have been a criminal barrister for 20 years prosecuting and defending. I have not taken on any cases since the general election, but I still sit as a recorder in the Crown court.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> One of the later questions, of which we gave you notice, relates to universal jurisdiction. I happen to be the president of the Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel.</p>

  <p><strong>Mr Llwyd</strong> I have prosecuted and defended cases both as a solicitor and barrister. I have not done any prosecution work since April 2010.</p>

  <p><strong>Yasmin Qureshi</strong> I have also prosecuted and defended. I have not done any private work, or any work to do with law, since February of last year. I also used to work for the Crown Prosecution Service. I was there for about 10 years and was a special case worker for a few years. A member of my family is a higher court advocate currently in the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> That done, I invite Mr Llwyd to ask questions.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q1</strong> Mr Llwyd: Mr Starmer, what general advice is given to prosecutors on the use of joint enterprise? Are you aware of any particular advice issued to the police?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> There is no particular advice we give to prosecutors. They have been well used to using joint enterprise over the years, and we have not given them any specific or different advice. I am not sure what the position is in relation to the police, but I suspect that most difficult joint enterprise cases would be charged by us. Therefore, they would probably take their lead from us, but I do not know whether they have issued specific advice. If they have, I have not seen it.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q2</strong> Mr Llwyd: It strikes me as rather odd that we cannot find any statistics on the number of joint enterprise cases. Nowadays, there are statistics to prove and disprove everything on earth. It seems to me rather strange that there are no statistics to show how often it is being used. In your experience, for which offences is joint enterprise most commonly used?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> It is available for pretty well all offences, unless there is a statutory reason it cannot be used. It is very commonly used for violence, affray, burglary and those sorts of offences. They would be the most common ones, but as a matter of law, it is available for pretty much all offences.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back on the point about statistics, I understand any concerns that the Committee may have on this. I think the reason there are not specific statistics is that at the moment the prosecutor can, and arguably should, charge an individual both as a principal and as a secondary party in the same indictment. There is an argument that as a matter of law you have to do that. At the outset, the advantage for the prosecutor is being able to charge in that broad and, if you like, alternative way. The only way to collect statistics would be to try to work out after the event, looking at jury verdicts, whether they had in fact convicted on the basis of the principal offence or secondary liability. I accept that can probably be done, but it is not something we have done up to now. Therefore, unlike other offences where we are able to put a flag in the system when an offence is charged and then marry it up to a conviction, that is simply not possible under our current arrangements. I think that is why you do not have statistics, though I understand your concern about not having them.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q3</strong> Mr Llwyd: There is a belief that perhaps some police forces tend to overuse joint enterprise as a tool to deal with gang crime, for example.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> As you may hear later this morning, there are concerns both ways. For most of the bigger cases we would probably be involved in the charging decision. These days there are not many big joint enterprise cases that are charged by the police.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q4</strong> Mr Llwyd: This is difficult for you to answer, is it not? Is the use of joint enterprise by prosecutors on the increase? I understand if you cannot answer.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I am afraid I cannot answer that; it goes back to the statistics. All I can say is that the advice and general approach has not changed. Therefore, there is no reason for a difference in the figures, but because I do not have the figures I cannot give you a complete answer.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q5</strong> Mr Llwyd: In effect, what you are saying, quite rightly, is that joint enterprise very often is a belt-and-braces process where an individual might be charged in the indictment in that capacity but also as part of the joint enterprise.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> "Joint enterprise" is a very unhelpful term. Some academics do not use it. For example, David Ormerod does not use that description. He distinguishes, rightly I think, between liabilities as a principal and liability as an accessory and limits his analysis to those two doctrines. What is possible, and arguably ought to be done, is that where the prosecution cannot clearly establish whether someone is a principal or an accessory they charge essentially both, and to that extent they do not have to nail their colours to the mast until slightly later in the process.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q6</strong> Mr Llwyd: You will be aware that recently there have been many appeal cases about joint enterprise both as to conviction and sentence.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q7</strong> Mr Llwyd: A very important case is pending in the Supreme Court which I cannot name for obvious reasons.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Yes; that is our case.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q8</strong> Chair: We cannot discuss it.</p>

  <p><strong>Mr Llwyd</strong> No, indeed.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> No, but I am obviously well aware of it.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q9</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: What evidence would you expect prosecutors to have when alleging that a young defendant is part of a gang? This is a pejorative connotation. How do you define "gang" in this situation?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> For the purposes of charging as a principal or accessory you would not need to define "gang". Broadly speaking, you would charge a member of any group, gang or otherwise, as a principal if there was evidence that their conduct amounted to the full criminal offence. You would charge as an accessory if their conduct in itself did not amount to the full primary offence but in some way assisted, aided or abetted, et cetera. That would be the distinction. In an ordinary case, where what is contemplated happens, it does not make much difference because the charge will have within it both the principal and accessory liability. It will be open to us to charge an individual as a principal and, if we fail on that, to succeed in convicting as an accessory. There are no special rules here for gangs, but for groups that is the distinction we would be making.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q10</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: You will be aware that prosecutors have been accused of taking a dragnet approach to charging young people. I know it is difficult to collect statistics on it, but how do you counter the argument that it is just a simplistic way of pulling in a very large number of young people, often with quite limited evidence?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> The general rules of principal and secondary liability remain the same. Whatever concerns are expressed, if the charge is improperly brought, it will fail either at the close of the prosecution or the end of the case. That has not been happening in large numbers, so I conclude from it that whatever charges are being brought are proper charges; otherwise, the court would halt the case at the end of the prosecution case or the conviction would not follow.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q11</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Do the CPS take any account of the way in which public concerns over gangs are expressed, perhaps often in ignorance of the reality of young people's lives and the easy accusation that they are members of a gang? From my observations, there seems to be an increase in the number of prosecutions of gang-related offences when often evidence of gang membership is very flimsy indeed.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> The answer is no because we do not approach it by asking whether it is a gang case. We approach it by asking, "What is the primary offence here?" In relation to all the individuals we are considering, is there evidence that they were party to the main offence itself? If not, is there evidence that they aided, abetted, encouraged, et cetera? If the answer to both questions is no then any reference to gangs is irrelevant. They are the two legal questions. There is then the question of whether it is in the public interest to prosecute.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q12</strong> Chair: What was the final question to which you referred?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> The first question is, "Is there enough evidence against them as principals? Is there enough evidence against them as accessories?" If the answer to those two questions is no, there is nothing further to ask. If the answer is yes, the question is whether it is in the public interest to pursue the case. It rather depends on the circumstances, but if it is a serious assault or murder, the public interest would usually require a prosecution to be brought. But there is no special rule for gangs here. These are ordinary principles of liability as principals or accessories. They do not change; we do not approach them any differently, nor could we, because they are legal principles.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q13</strong> Ben Gummer: You discussed earlier the academic distinctions that have been drawn about how you might define joint enterprise or otherwise. How does that permeate into your decision making at CPS and decisions that courts are making? There does not seem to be a close definition with which you are happy.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I think the rival positions are these. Everybody accepts that you should calibrate culpability. The question is at what stage in the process you do it. Using the law as it is now, the calibration exercise usually happens towards the end of the trial, probably at the sentencing stage. Those who argue that that is too broad or generous to the prosecution would rather have culpability calibrated earlier in the process and thus have more specific offences for the prosecutor to choose specifically what it is they allege against the particular individual. They are the two rival positions. Our approach is simply to apply the law as it is now, but I accept that to some extent that allows us at the outset to prosecute someone both as a principal and, in the alternative, as an accessory.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q14</strong> Ben Gummer: Is there not another calibration going on concerning those defendants who might act as witnesses against their co-principals?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> In the sense that they are not prosecuted because we want them as witnesses?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q15</strong> Ben Gummer: Yes; and they might be dealt with more leniently if they act as witnesses against their co-principals.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> This is a very difficult question to answer. In each case, one will have to consider what powers are available to prosecute. If there is evidence that someone may have participated in the offence and there is any kind of immunity from prosecutorial action, broadly speaking, that is now codified in the law. There would have to be agreement as to how we would use anybody in that situation, which is a different area of the law.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q16</strong> Ben Gummer: Let me turn it on its head.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> In other words, you are asking whether, if you have a main participant whom you think can give evidence against the other members of the group, in certain circumstances, you would not prosecute that individual so that you can secure them as a witness. The answer is that that is legally available to us but it is now regulated by statute. It happens but only in the circumstances permitted by the statute. I am afraid that, without considerable research, I am not able to tell you, if at all, the extent to which those agreements are used in joint enterprise cases. To some extent they are bound to be used in cases where there is more than one offender.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q17</strong> Ben Gummer: We will move on to this later, but I know there is a public perception that these agreements happen and that damages confidence in the process.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> That was why it became regulated.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q18</strong> Ben Gummer: Do you think that is having a beneficial impact on public perception?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> It is difficult to measure. The fact that there is a statutory regime in which the circumstances in which agreements can be made are clear, with internal guidance about the level of authority, ought to give a degree of confidence that these agreements are being made in accordance with the law. On occasion, we have been asked for the figures showing the number of cases where agreements have been reached with witnesses who have participated in crime. They were broken down in an answer to a parliamentary question tabled just before the summer to drive at that question of how often they are being used and how that affects public confidence, but, as I understand it, the idea of putting this on a statutory footing is that it makes clear when such agreements can be struck and where the level of authority lies. My view is that that does give a greater degree of confidence than to leave it to arrangements which have developed over time but are not regulated by statute.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q19</strong> Ben Gummer: That is helpful. On the other side, do you think that at any time the doctrine of joint enterprise acts to deters witnesses?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Do you mean pure witnesses or those who have participated?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q20</strong> Chair: Let us say I am around when the attack happens. I have been out drinking with the same group all evening, but I have not been charged or brought into a joint enterprise. Do I go to the police and say, "I was there and I have a pretty good idea of what happened, but of course I held back when the trouble really started", or do I just stay out of the way and avoid the risk of a joint enterprise prosecution being brought against me, in case I have helped to plan it?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I see the argument. The honest truth is that I do not know. I can see an argument can be made that some people may be reluctant to come forward lest they have unknowingly crossed the line into criminality.</p>

  <p><strong>Ben Gummer</strong> I was groping for a situation, but Sir Alan shows more familiarity with it.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q21</strong> Chair: I am not sure it is a very convincing example.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> It is one of those questions that is very difficult to answer. Did the witness not come forward for the following reason? The fact they did not come forward means you are probably unlikely to find out. I accept the point that, if the net is cast wide on joint enterprise, broadly speaking, people may have crossed the line in circumstances where they did not appreciate they had. I accept that concern, but it is pretty difficult to answer the question.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q22</strong> Mr Buckland: To develop that, the obvious and proper point we need to explore is whether or not there is a wider public policy interest in maintaining a law of joint enterprise to send a message to people who get involved in enterprises, whether they be burglaries in which people act as lookouts or getaway facilitators or other types of crime where perhaps people are holding back who potentially can assist and prevent an assault. A message is being sent out that just because you have a minor role does not mean you should not take your fair share of responsibility, but your degree of involvement will be reflected in sentence. Is there not a wider public policy interest in that respect?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I do understand that. There is also the very practical advantage, which needs to be considered if options are to be examined by the Committee, that in a fairly complicated set of circumstances, it is very difficult at the outset necessarily to pinpoint the precise acts of each individual when a number of people are acting as a group. If you require that to be done, as it were, up front and before the prosecution starts, you run the risk of an overly technical prosecution which may fail to prove the particular act, but during the trial it is pretty clear that the individual, though not guilty of the acts specified, is guilty of other acts. These things may be catered for. I do not think anybody says there is no alternative model, but there are advantages and disadvantages in the current approach and any changed approach. My greater concern would be genuinely those cases where you have a reasonably large number of people and it is very difficult at the outset to say that is precisely what is alleged and nothing else and everything else is clear. That is quite difficult in those cases.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q23</strong> Mr Buckland: One can imagine trying to settle an indictment which potentially could become impossibly overloaded, confusing and unhelpful to a jury, or anybody, as part of a case.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I agree with that. You have to add to that the prospect that the individual may give evidence to say he foresaw <em>x</em> but not <em>y</em>, and that may change the position. The current approach allows all of that to be accommodated within the trial and the sentencer then to sentence according to culpability if there is a conviction. There is that advantage in the current approach.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q24</strong> Mr Buckland: I suppose the one exception would be murder and the mandatory life sentence. There are tariff issues as well, are there not?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> The current approach, broadly speaking, calibrates culpability at the end of the exercise through sentence. Most of the time that ought to work reasonably well. It obviously does not work well with fixed sentences, murder being the obvious one. There is the tariff within the life sentence, but for everything else you can calibrate much more carefully according to the individual. I can see the disadvantages of the current approach, one of which is that, if someone has played a very minor part in a very serious offence but is none the less convicted, they are convicted of that very serious offence. I think some juries may feel that it simply does not feel fair to convict someone for playing a very small part in a very serious offence, so it may be slightly counterproductive. I do not think this is an area where the arguments are all one way.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q25</strong> Mr Buckland: You will be aware that the Law Commission published its report "Participating in Crime" back in 2007 at about the same time the Serious Crime Act was enacted which changed the law in some measure with regard to some inchoate offences. I believe sections 44 to 46 changed the law.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q26</strong> Mr Buckland: First, how effective do you think those provisions have been? Are they used often?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> They are not used very often. Because it is a specific offence, we are able to give some statistics. I have them somewhere and will happily provide them to the Committee. What I can say in broad terms is that they have not been used very often.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q27</strong> Mr Buckland: Second, do you think that perhaps it would have been good then, or now, to have widened the reform to put the law of joint enterprise, common purpose, primary liability, principal liability—whatever you want to call it—on a statutory footing?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I can see the argument that what the Law Commission was really driving at was a narrowing of the liability of principals but a broadening of the circumstances in which there could be liability of secondary parties. Part 2 of their analysis has been put, broadly speaking, on a statutory footing, but part 1 has been left unimplemented or not acted upon. I am neutral as to whether that should be done. There are advantages and disadvantages, and it may depend on how it is done. If it is proposed that the law is narrowed to the point where the prosecution have to particularise the very act up front, you run a risk. You can see the fairness argument on both sides. If you are a victim of crime and someone appears to be acquitted because technically they did not do the act that the prosecution sought to prove but it is pretty clear they were involved, there will be a perceived injustice on the part of the victim. On the other hand, I can see the argument that, if you are a defendant, it is only fair that you know in as great a detail as possible precisely what is alleged against you at the earliest possible moment and you are judged on that. I can see the perceived injustice. My only concern about putting part&nbsp;1 of the Law Commission's proposals on a statutory footing is that, if it makes the law overly technical, you may run the risk of injustice. I am sure that if Parliament decides that is what needs to be done it is possible to come up with a scheme, but it really is not straightforward.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q28</strong> Yasmin Qureshi: Is it right that normally when people are considering whether or not there is a joint enterprise, if there is evidence to suggest that the person on the periphery of the group was in some way aiding, assisting, counselling, procuring, or even lending encouragement, according to case law they can be properly convicted anyway? Therefore, the law as it currently stands is not completely at a tangent, is it?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> No. There are two big issues here. The first is whether you should be convicted of a serious offence even if you have participated only in some very small way by encouraging, aiding, abetting, et cetera. The second big issue is what happens when what everybody contemplates does not happen and somebody does something that nobody really expected them to do. The classic example is the gang that goes out for a fight, one or more members pull out a knife and there is a murder. There, the current approach allows an individual who may have started out as a principal, as it were, to drop into a secondary role and none the less be convicted as a secondary party, depending on the circumstances. Broadly speaking, that works certainly from the point of view of prosecution. That is why there needs to be some caution if there is any amendment to it, but one accepts that this is complicated and one can understand the concerns on either side.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q29</strong> Chair: Would you regard it as a serious limitation on your ability successfully to prosecute culpable people of very serious crimes if you did not have the joint enterprise routes to take?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Yes, I think it would be.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> We will turn now to another issue. I ask Mr&nbsp;Corbyn to talk about private arrest warrants for offences of universal jurisdiction.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q30</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Thank you for coming today. You will be aware of the debates about universal jurisdiction and the way in which the law was changed to remove the opportunity for a private arrest warrant to be sought at the magistrates court. We had before us the Attorney-General, who assured us that the Director of Public Prosecutions would issue guidelines on the use of private prosecution for offences that qualified for universal jurisdiction. What will these guidelines say, and for whom are they written?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> The guidelines are now in draft and I intend to make them public so that everybody can see them. They are written for our prosecutors to apply, but they are to be made available to the public so that they can understand the basis on which we seek to make decisions. They are in draft form at the moment. We have a panel of interested parties and groups with which we liaise on questions of universal jurisdiction, including Amnesty, Redress and so on. I think we have a meeting with them in mid-November. The guidelines are in draft until we have had a chance to walk through them with that group and any other interested party.</p>

  <p>The guidelines in draft reflect the evidence that I gave to the Bill Committee indicating that consent for an arrest warrant would be given, broadly speaking, only if the code test was satisfied, namely, that there was a realistic prospect of a conviction based on the evidence, with a caveat for urgent cases. That is the approach I said I would take, and that is in the draft guidelines. They will be in draft for a few weeks more, but once they are finalised they will be made public.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q31</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: What opportunities do you envisage for members of the public to approach you or your office to mount an arrest warrant, for example, in a case where somebody living here in a diaspora community becomes aware of someone against whom there is prima facie evidence of war crimes, or crimes against humanity, in their own country, perhaps arriving at very short notice or unexpectedly in this country where it could be possible to arrest them? Would you be prepared to receive representations from a private citizen under those conditions?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Yes, and we have. What we encourage, which is why we have a dialogue with the most interested groups, is that they come to us much earlier because, whatever your perspective, working at 24 or 48 hours' notice is not ideal, for very obvious reasons. We encourage them to come early and, if possible, to allow the police to do an investigation, as long as it is a proper one to carry out, because it is far better for the police to do it.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q32</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: That was to be my next question. Would you automatically pass a case over to the police, or would you take a marginal decision in a particular case to grant the arrest warrant but that is it, and not pass it over to the police to investigate to collect the relevant evidence?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> It depends. Our preference is to pass it to the police because in a proper case they have coercive powers: they can search and seize, and they can interview. A private individual cannot. There is a huge advantage, if there is a proper case, if it is investigated by the police in terms of evidence that is admissible in court. But some individuals come to us either too late in the day or do not want the police to investigate, because they believe they have already assembled enough evidence and ask us to assess it there and then. They tend to be the ones that come late in the day. In those cases, we have assessed it as best we can in the time available. But we have created a dialogue. In one example a few weeks ago, for about 48 hours or so we were working very closely with the private individuals in constant dialogue about the case.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q33</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Both the last Government and current one have said in the House in terms that foreign policy considerations should have a bearing upon the potential, or otherwise, for an arrest warrant to be issued. That was one of the reasons they gave for removing the direct access of the private citizen to Westminster magistrates court in this case. Do you have any foreign policy considerations, or do you take a strictly legal view of prima facie evidence of war crimes or crimes against humanity?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Under the code we are bound to ask whether there is sufficient evidence and then to go on to consider the public interest. Within the public interest there are a wide number of factors. I think it is inevitable that at the stage the Attorney-General would come to give consent to a prosecution in these cases—he must consent in all of them—he would want to take into account any relevant policy considerations in terms of international relations. That creates a situation where I am being asked to consent to an arrest warrant at a stage very shortly before one is granted, if it is. The Attorney-General will then be asked whether he consents to the prosecution. As I told the Bill Committee, in those circumstances I would in most, if not all, cases want to consult the Attorney-General about the approach he might take to consent, because I do not think it is to anybody's benefit for an arrest warrant to be issued followed promptly by a refusal by the Attorney-General to consent.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q34</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Do you think it is healthy that you as the DPP would consider there to be appropriate evidence against an individual from another jurisdiction against whom there is evidence and you then consult someone who is a politically appointed Minister who may well have many other considerations to bear in mind other than the strictly legal ones?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I think it is an inevitable consequence of our arrangements.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q35</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Are you comfortable with that?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> So far, yes. We have had only one case since the new arrangements were put in place. I have always been neutral on this. I have never put forward the view that the DPP ought to have to consent to an application for an arrest warrant or otherwise, but, having been given the powers, all I can do is exercise them in the way I indicated I would. First, we will be publishing open guidelines so that everybody knows the approach we are going to take; second, we will require sufficient evidence before we consent to a warrant; and, third, I think it is inevitable under the current arrangements that I will consult the Attorney-General.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q36</strong> Chair: On that point, it is perhaps worth saying that in this Committee previously, when the discussion about the relationship between the DPP and the Attorney-General took place, it was strongly of the view that it was the Attorney-General who had to take political responsibility for wider considerations rather than the DPP.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q37</strong> Chair: You would not be comfortable if it was your job to bring in such considerations of foreign policy?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> No, and it would not be. On one view, I could proceed to accede to an arrest warrant without consulting the Attorney-General, and I am not bound by what he says. That is the current arrangement which applies in many very sensitive cases day in, day out when we have a lot of communications. It is not something that applies only to universal jurisdiction. We are well aware of our functions and the fact I consult but I am not bound; so is the Attorney-General. My view is that there may be circumstances, but I cannot presently envisage them, in which it would be sensible for me on Monday to consent to an arrest warrant and on Tuesday for the Attorney­General to say he is not prepared to prosecute because he does not see that it will achieve very much.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q38</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: We were assured on the change that handing it over to the DPP to decide on an arrest warrant was, in part, trying to remove it from the political arena, but the procedure you have outlined seems to me to throw it straight back into that arena. Without public access, it is solely the view of the Attorney-General presumably on some kind of foreign policy consideration.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> I think it will depend on a case-by-case basis. The decision is mine and mine alone. In the recent case, I made it absolutely clear that it was my decision and responsibility. I consulted the Attorney-General, not least because, in that particular case, an unusual form of immunity arose. The wider considerations are for the Attorney-General and it may well be that he is not in a position to consider those wider issues at the point I consult him. These things tend to happen in very quick time. To that extent, it is insulated but, given that for all these offences, the Attorney-General must consent, the decision whether there is a prosecution is his, not mine. This was the reason we went for the code test.</p>

  <p>With a private prosecutor, there are no coercive powers, so whatever you have to put before the magistrate for the arrest warrant is probably your case to prosecute, because you cannot search, interview, seize or add to your evidence. Obviously, this is a general proposition. Your file of evidence is the basis upon which you have to decide whether to issue an arrest warrant, and it is probably the basis on which you will have to decide whether to prosecute, unlike every other case where the police arrest and there is an opportunity to add to the evidence. That was why I took the view that you had to be pretty well satisfied that a prosecution would follow before you decided to arrest an individual, because that is the practical reality. If they are arrested and are in custody, they will be brought before the court the same day or next day. We are talking about very short periods of time, and the Attorney-General's consent will come very quickly in the process. Those are the arrangements.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q39</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Will the draft procedures that you are drawing up now after consultation be open for public comment by this Committee or the public in general?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Keir Starmer</strong></em> The way we have approached it is to work with our panel of interested parties, but I have no issue about sharing them with the Committee or anyone else who wants to comment on them. We have what we call a community involvement panel which is comprised basically of individuals or organisations who have been particularly concerned about their ability to bring private prosecutions. We meet them every four or six months. They seem to us to be the obvious group with which to walk through the guidelines, but that is not a hard and fast rule and I have no issue with anybody else commenting on them.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> Thank you very much. I think we would now like to move on to more aspects of the subject we were discussing earlier. We are very grateful to you, Mr Starmer, for the evidence you have given us this morning.
  
  </p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> Mrs Taylor and Mrs Jones, welcome to you both. We very much appreciate your coming in front of the Committee today. We know that you have both had dreadful family experiences having been victims of crime and, therefore, that you have a very important perspective on these matters. I will ask Yasmin Qureshi to ask some questions.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q40</strong> Yasmin Qureshi: Thank you very much for coming to the Committee. You heard the Director of Public Prosecutions talk about how the CPS approach the issue of joint enterprise. How has a lack of clarity about the doctrine of joint enterprise affected your families and the crimes against members of your families? I do not mean your families but generally.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> I just have to give the warning that as a Committee we cannot investigate individual cases, only the broad experience. You have also now met many other people with similar experience, have you not?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> My case involved my son Andrew and a gang. The CPS said they couldn't take it into court because it wasn't in the public interest. I can't understand how some people can be important and some can't. Why isn't everybody in the public interest? At the end of the day, that person is dead the same as a person who is in the public interest is dead. Why can't the person who has no public interest have justice the same as the person who has?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q41</strong> Chair: Was that the full extent of what they told you?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> Yes, it was.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q42</strong> Chair: That it was not in the public interest?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> It was, yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q43</strong> Yasmin Qureshi: Did they go into any details as to why they said it was not in the public interest?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> They said it was not in the public interest to take it back into court.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q44</strong> Yasmin Qureshi: To take it back into court?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> Yes. Only one out of 10 went into court and he walked out of court for lack of evidence. When we asked why they couldn't all go in, they said it wasn't in the public interest.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Andrew Jones, the son of Christine Jones, was on his own walking down a side street in Liverpool city centre. He was making his way home after an evening out with his friends. He was confronted on that side street by a group of youths, and in that group were two females. They decided to pick on Andrew. One punched him—that was witnessed—while another one stamped on his head as he lay on the floor dying of his injuries. All members of that group were then held by a Merseyside police officer who came along. He knew the whole group was there, and someone in that group, no matter which one at that stage, should have been taken into custody and spoken to, because the officer knew that Andrew was seriously ill or dying on the floor. Instead, the officer got hold of one of them and said to that group, "I saw you strike a blow at this gentleman." The female who was the girlfriend of the perpetrator said, "No. I think you've made a mistake", and the officer let that perpetrator go. It wasn't until several days later that they were all rearrested. DNA evidence was lost.</p>

  <p>My argument here is that joint enterprise has been used in more serious high-profile cases. That is a word we do not like to use in Families Fighting for Justice. In a high-profile case, all of them would have been arrested and no doubt charged with joint enterprise. My argument is that, with a joint enterprise, it is either a shared intention or foresight. In the case of Andrew Jones, it was not a shared intention but foresight, because prior to the perpetrator punching him, he frogmarched him backwards down that side road. With the foresight of that group, the intention was to cause Andrew Jones some harm.</p>

  <p>I fail to see how joint enterprise works in those cases where they are all taken in just for standing by and watching and yet in this case joint enterprise wasn't used. We cannot allow joint enterprise. Law must be seen to be a fair law in this country. I am not here to judge any particular case and say joint enterprise should or should not have been used. My argument here is, "What about the likes of this group who did that?" There are many cases up and down this country where a group or gang has been allowed to walk free, and still do so today. They have not been charged with joint enterprise.</p>

  <p>We know this law is 300 years old; we know it is time for change. We know there is a growing gang culture. At the moment, Families Fighting for Justice are delivering workshops up and down Liverpool. We believe that those workshops deter youngsters from gang culture. It is not done by delivering it through the police but through families who know what is needed and who carry the pain of losing a loved one.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, to go back to joint enterprise, I strongly believe that it is time for change with joint enterprise. I am not saying we should do away with it altogether. Maybe we could introduce another law or tweak the one that is there already. It is 300 years old and it is time for change. We cannot say that, because one group is more in the media light, shall we say, it should be charged with joint enterprise. Yet some of them may not be members of a gang. I remember that when I had a meeting with Iain Duncan Smith, the question was asked how we could say they are part of a gang. We can easily say they are part of a gang. The local police will know whether they are part of a gang. They have a uniform that we all know they wear to say they are part of a gang. We know what they wear and know if they are part of a gang. There are groups that in some cases are not part of a gang, but in more high-profile cases, they are charged with joint enterprise. Some have just stood idly by watching, maybe afraid to give evidence. Should they have been charged with aiding and abetting?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q45</strong> Chair: You have made the point several times that high-profile cases have involved joint enterprise. It could be that we are aware of those cases because they have a lot of media attention.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q46</strong> Chair: Do you have any reason to believe that something about the high-profile nature of the case leads prosecutors to use joint enterprise, rather than simply different practice between different police forces and different branches of the Crown Prosecution Service?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes, I do.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q47</strong> Chair: You think that in some way prosecutors are attracted to use joint enterprise if they are aware that there is a big media interest in the case.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes, I do.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q48</strong> Yasmin Qureshi: What specific reforms would you like to see to the doctrine of joint enterprise?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> For instance, what if there was not premeditation in the case of Andrew Jones? Take that family and the Lavelle family in my group. Kevin Lavelle was left dying while he was on the phone to his fiancée. That group, again, was allowed to walk free. Maybe we need to introduce a new law; maybe we need Andrew's Law; maybe joint enterprise needs to change. It most definitely needs to change. As Sir&nbsp;Alan says, it is so easy to have high-profile cases where police officers say, "Okay. They're shouting. It's in the public interest. Let's charge them all with joint enterprise." The law must be seen to be fair. I am afraid that if it is there to be used some will use it that way, and that is wrong.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q49</strong> Yasmin Qureshi: I am only exploring this question with you. Is there a possibility that, because there has not been proper communication between the families of the victims and the Crown Prosecution Service or the police to explain why they took a specific decision in a specific case, perhaps this could be the reason why there is a misunderstanding and why in a particular case a prosecution does not take place and in another case it does?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> I strongly believe there is a lack of communication among the CPS, police and the families. There is a huge gap and lack of information. They should be working together more closely. I see families who have carried the pain of no justice, and yet I say to myself, "Insight? Foresight? Why wasn't it given?" It is always in the public interest. We owe it to ourselves to help make society a safer place, but this country must be seen as having a law that is fair and also that we do not lose deterrence. I believe there is lack of communication with the CPS, the police and victims' families, but we must always say that, of course, it is in the public interest. In Liverpool, the public are aware of the perpetrators who did what they did to Andrew Jones that night, yet they are allowed to walk free. Why? Because there is no law under which they could have been sentenced. Did joint enterprise fit? Was it good enough? Why wasn't it good enough? They were all there and still they remained silent; they built up that wall of silence. That wall of silence must not be allowed to continue.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q50</strong> Mr Llwyd: First, perhaps I may say to both of you that we are in complete sympathy with you. We understand the trauma that both families have gone through, and we are trying to look at both sides of the argument, so do not think that we are being in any way antipathetic if I ask a question.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> No, not at all; I fully understand that. Thank you.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q51</strong> Mr Llwyd: You will know, for example, that the Metropolitan Police have publicly said that joint enterprise is a useful tool in dealing with gang crime.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q52</strong> Mr Llwyd: Therefore, you believe that it has a deterrent role in deterring young people from gang culture. Do you believe that to be right?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q53</strong> Mr Llwyd: Earlier you said that joint enterprise did not fit the bill in terms of what happened to Mrs Jones's son. You will also appreciate that there are many stages to look at the evidence in order to found a proper prosecution for joint enterprise.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q54</strong> Mr Llwyd: There must have been foreseeability. There must have been a real issue as to an immediate degree of violence occurring which would have been reasonably foreseeable, and so on. I do not know the circumstances, but it is possible, is it not, that some of those who were bystanders, as it were, were not in the know as to what was going to happen that evening?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> I will not mention any particular case, but I know there are cases where they could not foresee what was going to happen. You cannot foresee something unless it has been arranged prior to it happening. If it happens instantly, how could the rest of that group see that, all of a sudden, there is this fight or attack? How could they foresee that if it happened instantaneously? Again, if it goes into the media as high profile, they will be charged.</p>

  <p>I have many other cases; I am not just going to talk about Andrew Jones. I have the Kevin Lavelle case. There are a lot of other cases up and down this country. I know the Committee can't get involved in any one particular case or do anything about what happened. I am not asking for that. But, just to educate you a little further on the Andrew Jones case, one of the group stated that the perpetrator had tried to cause some trouble earlier in the evening with some other innocent victim. Her words in that statement were, "He was out for trouble. We could tell he was out for trouble." By frogmarching Mr Jones backwards down that side street, that was the foresight about what was going to happen. With aggression, that is foresight, yet because the Andrew Jones case was not high profile enough they were not charged with joint enterprise. We cannot allow joint enterprise to be charged at random just because it is thick in the media and to say, "Right; we've got convictions." This is what's happening. We have given these workshops, which are funded by the Home Office, in areas of Liverpool where there is a growing gang culture. I know that for gangs it is a deterrent, but we are also talking about groups.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q55</strong> Chair: Following on from Mr Llwyd's question, you work a lot with young people who might be caught up in these situations?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q56</strong> Chair: Do you think deterrence works in the sense that they are aware, "If I get involved in that or if I am on the scene, they might get me for joint enterprise"? I am perhaps a little sceptical that young people think in those terms and are even aware of the legal process to which they might be subject if they stay in the crowd where this is happening. Do you think there is a deterrent awareness where people say, "I must stay away from there or I might be done for joint enterprise"?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> To be honest with you, Sir Alan, I think they need to be educated further on joint enterprise. You would be extremely surprised how many youngsters don't understand joint enterprise. That is something I include in the workshops that I deliver in and around Liverpool. I strongly believe there are no better people to do that tour. It is no good a police officer getting up there, because they don't like the police; they don't welcome the police. Families go in and do these workshops. There needs to be far more education on joint enterprise for those who are members of a gang.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q57</strong> Mr Llwyd: Following on from that point and Sir Alan's question, is misunderstanding of joint enterprise leading to witnesses not coming forward?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes, I would say so. I know of a case—again, I won't disclose names—where one member of the group went with one or both parents to the police station and gave evidence of what he saw when the gentleman was attacked. He later died. Yet he thought that by doing so he was doing the right thing. Again, it was a high-profile case, but that gentleman is now serving time in prison, yet he helped the police; he gave a statement. Does that steer them away? What message are we sending out? If they give statements, will they still be charged with joint enterprise?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q58</strong> Mr Llwyd: Some evidence we have had from the university of Oxford suggests that only 21% of the public consider that murder convictions based on the doctrine of joint enterprise are things they can support. In other words, only 21% of the public support convictions for murder based on joint enterprise. If you do not have a comment, it does not matter.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> I don't know what to say really, to be honest. Do you have any comment to make on that, Christine?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> It is because a lot of them don't understand what it really means. They are scared to give their comment and to support it because they barely understand what it means.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q59</strong> Mr Llwyd: I have a final question that I suspect should be to both of you. How do you believe public confidence in joint enterprise can be strengthened? You are doing workshops in Merseyside and so on. How do you believe that things can be improved in terms of public confidence?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> I am not sure of the figure. It may be that £18 million has been pumped into deterring youths, gangs and guns. I think that right across the board there needs to be education on the whole thing by ordinary families, but, going back to joint enterprise, it must be seen that it will not just be thrown around and used. I know that there are young men who have been convicted of joint enterprise, maybe rightly so, and are members of a gang, but I also believe there are those inside prison who maybe should have been charged only with aiding and abetting and not given the lengthy sentence they were given. That is why we have to be careful. I have read quite a lot about joint enterprise and, to be honest, it is a very complicated common law.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q60</strong> Elizabeth Truss: I want to ask about the specifics on legislation. It seems to me that a lot of this issue is to do with the way it is being interpreted by the police and the CPS. Is it the case that, rather than necessarily needing new legislation, guidance could be offered to those organisations on the way joint enterprise ought to be applied? I just want to add to Mr&nbsp;Llwyd's point about the Oxford study. Maybe more flexibility is required within joint enterprise so that lesser charges, such as being an accessory, can be included within it. Maybe the police can be given more flexibility. I do not know your view on that. Is the mechanism really a new law, because it seems that the law on joint enterprise is being applied correctly in some cases? It is just a question of the consistency of its application.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> The local police would know where the gangs are and who they are. If that gang is in front of the courts then it can be joint enterprise, but what if they are not part of a gang? If they are not part of a gang, how can you throw joint enterprise at them? I think a lot of faith has been lost.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q61</strong> Mr Buckland: That is a very fair point, Mrs Taylor. If there is not evidence of a pre-conceived purpose, as you would have with a gang, it will depend on the facts of the case. If a group of people who were not part of a gang all knew that the principal had a knife, that would be foreseeability and a joint enterprise.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q62</strong> Mr Buckland: It would then depend on the facts of the case, would it not?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes, and then we could go back to the case of Andrew Jones. That involved foresight, yet joint enterprise was not charged. I think it needs to be used only in certain cases. If it is going to be used, maybe it should apply to gang members, but not when it is proven they are not part of the gang. If they were out causing a fracas on the night, it should be aiding and abetting. We should not be sending somebody to prison for 15 or 17 years because he stands there and because it is high profile.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q63</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Thank you both very much for coming and giving evidence; it is extremely helpful to our inquiry.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Thank you.</p>

  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> What response would you give to criticisms that joint enterprise is sometimes used as a dragnet leading to young people being wrongly described as gang members and, therefore, convicted of involvement in an offence? Since you have been involved in this for quite a while, what suggestions would you make for any legal changes to deal with this issue?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> I think that, if it was to be used in that way, where it was thought they were part of it, they would need proof. The police officers would know if they were part of a gang or not; they operate in those areas. Last night in Liverpool alone, there was an incident involving two young men. How old were they, Christine?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> They were between 18 and 21.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean <em><strong>Taylor</strong></em></strong></em> There was crossfire in the street; there were children there. It was not only there but in the area where Rhys Jones was shot. That was only last night in Liverpool.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q64</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: But the point is that, if the joint enterprise law is used, anyone who was present at that incident, or any other incident where gangs were involved, can be accused of being part of a joint enterprise. You and I know perfectly well that young people growing up in difficult environments feel the need to be involved in a gang for their own security. It does not make them criminals; it does not make them bad, but it means they are in a society where they are worried. They can then end up being prosecuted for something about which they perhaps knew nothing but just happened to be in the vicinity of the incident at the time. Do you think that is a problem with the law?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> Yes, it is a problem.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> It is a problem but I think they should be educated further. If you are going to walk around with your hood up and a mask across your face, you are part of a gang. That gang, I'm afraid, is out to do some harm, whether it is the gang across the road or whatever. They need to be educated about the seriousness of it and what it could lead to.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q65</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Nobody is condoning gangs; certainly I do not, and I do not think anybody round this table is. But the point I am making is that the use of the joint enterprise law consolidates membership and strengthens the cohesion of a gang rather than reducing it and breaking it apart, because the evidence required to get prosecution of joint enterprise is rather less than the forensic evidence required for the primary prosecution.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> Joint enterprise should be used for breaking down walls of silence. There are people out there at the moment who know what has been going on; they just keep it to themselves and do not come forward and tell. You should be able to go into a police station, give a statement and then come out. If you are willing to give a statement of what you have seen and tried to stop you should not be put away, but if you have kept quiet behind a wall of silence for so many years why shouldn't you be put away? You are part of that gang, and that is why you are keeping quiet.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q66</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: That is really helpful. Do you feel that local, regional and national media have a role to play in this and could do quite a lot to change attitudes towards this, or not?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q67</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: In which case, what advice would you give them?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> I would tell them that specific people are not more important than others. They are highlighting some people and making them high profile. There is pressure on the CPS, the police and everyone to find somebody to convict. There is no pressure for a conviction in those cases where there is no publicity. That is why some are being prosecuted and some are not.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> It then becomes an unfair law.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q68</strong> Ben Gummer: I want to take further the point about high-profile cases and your contention that because they are high profile the CPS put in the effort to try to prosecute. Does that mean that you think their failure to do so elsewhere is because they cannot be bothered, because it is too difficult or because the resources are not there? In your minds, what is the reason for them not doing so when there is no media interest?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Christine Jones</strong></em> In my mind, the CPS decide who to prosecute. Nobody has a say in whether or not they are going to go to court; it is up to the CPS to decide who goes to court. It should not be. As far as I am concerned, everybody should go through the court. It is up to the jury or judge to find them guilty or not guilty, not the CPS. Why should they decide who goes through and who does not?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q69</strong> Ben Gummer: Mrs Taylor, you also made a point about high-profile cases. Why do you believe that in low-profile cases the CPS are not making the effort? What is the reason they are not doing so in low-profile cases?</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> If it is the case.</p>

  <p><strong>Ben Gummer</strong> If it is the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> It could be cost-effective as well. There is more pressure on them when it is high profile. The public want answers. Christine has reasons why she thinks that is so that she does not wish to disclose here. They know they have a job to do, and when it is in the public interest and it is out there in the media they have got to be seen to do that job properly.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q70</strong> Chair: Although the Director of Public Prosecutions has given his oral evidence today, we will draw to his attention your belief that high-profile cases are more likely to be the subject of joint enterprise than other cases where it is appropriate. We will give him the opportunity to respond to us on the point you have raised.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Jean Taylor</strong></em> Thank you very much.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> We are very grateful to you for the evidence you have given us and the thorough way you have done it. We very much appreciate it.
  
  </p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q71</strong> Chair: Dr Green and Ms Morrison, welcome. Are you both involved in Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association? My note does not make that quite clear.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Yes, we are.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> We are grateful to you for coming to give evidence. We know that you are looking at the matter from a different perspective from that of the previous witnesses, namely, those who get caught up in joint enterprise cases, perhaps inappropriately or unjustly so. I ask Elizabeth Truss to open the questioning.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q72</strong> Elizabeth Truss: We have just heard from the two previous witnesses that, in prosecuting cases, joint enterprise is sometimes used and sometimes not. Do you think it is used in a consistent way across the country? What would be your observation about its present use?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> My response to what we have just been hearing is that, of course, we do not know of that particular case. The cases that come to our attention are those where people have been prosecuted; those are the only ones of which we know. To me, it sounded significant that one of the witnesses said the police had lost DNA evidence in the case. I wondered whether it was a case of incompetence rather than making a judgment on the degree to which it was a high-profile case. Our impression is that the police are extremely keen to clear up every murder case and put whatever effort they think is necessary into doing so. It would be very unusual for them to make any distinction between something they deem high profile or otherwise.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q73</strong> Elizabeth Truss: You mention murder cases, but what about across the board in other cases as well? We heard from the DPP that, in theory, joint enterprise could be used to prosecute all kinds of cases. Can you tell me a little more about where you think it is being used, where it is being used inappropriately, and where it is not being used?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Very worryingly, joint enterprise is being used for the rioters. You are putting together a group of people who might have gone out to do something, which was to protest, but you did not do that with the students. They were not prosecuted under joint enterprise but the rioters are. You have a case involving 19 people, so you are saying they are all involved in the same enterprise. To me, it is such an abuse of the law that you are making it more elastic so that you can group together as many people as possible. As you will be aware, in the Victoria case, 20&nbsp;young people have all been convicted of one murder. Are 20 young people all culpable to the same extent for that one murder? It is a high-profile murder, but we do not know anything about it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a lot of low-profile cases. There are high-profile joint enterprises but a lot of low-profile ones that no one has ever heard about where people have gone to prison for something they did not foresee, they didn't intend, and they are serving life sentences.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q74</strong> Elizabeth Truss: I am interested in what you say about prosecution to the same extent in that prosecution. Do you think there could be more flexibility within joint enterprise so that there is a different extent? Why are all people being prosecuted to the same extent?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> I think the law of joint enterprise is a mess—the idea that you are going to have everybody knowingly having the same foresight in an incident that could take seconds. I met a family at the weekend. Four family members were walking home: the mum, her boyfriend and two 15-year-old girls. Chelsea crossed the road to a known drug dealer in the area, because she thought he was waving at her. Chelsea was slashed <em>there</em> and <em>there</em>; it required 35 stitches. She is serving a life sentence.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q75</strong> Elizabeth Truss: Is not the whole point that we want people to have more foresight and this should act as a deterrent to getting involved in riots or gangs? If there is a failure by people to take responsibility for their own actions, that is something being addressed by this law. Surely, the converse is that people are not expected to have any foresight.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> I am very interested to know how many of you actually understood what joint enterprise was until, thankfully, you began this brief inquiry. Young people are completely ignorant of this law. Most of the people we are supporting have never heard of joint enterprise until they are in the dock. Most of them, because they are innocent and have not done anything, or have no culpability, are told by their lawyers that they will not go to prison because they have not done anything. I want to move you away from the idea that this is targeting gangs. It is not. It is targeting anyone who is on the periphery of a crime or—not even on the periphery—on the end of a telephone. You can have a child who has sent a text message to their friends saying, "Let's go and get them feds", because of the riots. That is enough under joint enterprise to convict them.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q76</strong> Elizabeth Truss: Presumably, a jury will be there to make the decision whether or not that individual is culpable. You have mentioned the riots as well as gang membership. If the issue is that people are not educated about the potential for being charged under joint enterprise, is that not an argument for educating people and making it clearer to people that they could be held responsible if they are involved on the periphery of a riot or a gang? Is that not an argument for better education?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> There is definitely an argument for better education.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> There are a number of things. Education is patchy. Where I live in Sheffield all the children already seem to know about joint enterprise. I am not sure what effect it has; maybe it makes them stay in and play computer games rather than go out with their friends. It is also a question of the nature of deterrence in these circumstances. I think someone else on the Committee referred earlier to fast-moving incidents where anger flares up. I am not sure people develop ideas about foresight or their role in it in the time. It seems very unfair that they should be convicted of anything at all merely through inferences being drawn from the fact that they are present at a scene.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q77</strong> Elizabeth Truss: But we are not talking about people going out with their friends but about situations where a crime has been committed. I think it would be preferable that people were playing computer games at home rather than hanging around the periphery of a crime being committed. To me, it seems like a strange comparison to make.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> We have too many cases where you can talk about people going out with their friends. They are with their friends, not a gang, and something can kick off spontaneously, whether it is a punch or a fight. This has always happened, but should everybody be involved in that, or not involved in it, if someone has made a phone call? If you have a law like this, the police are using it not just as a deterrent but as a threat. Young people take a plea, say, to the lesser charge of manslaughter because they know that under joint enterprise they can get them all for joint enterprise. We have cases like that. There is one case involving nine boys in Liverpool. All of them took a plea of manslaughter because the police said, "We can get you for 25 years on joint enterprise." It is not an effective law that really roots out the guilty person and the not guilty person.</p>

  <p>The evidential bar is now lowered so much that you do not need to use any real evidence to prove that someone had the same foresight and intention. All you need to do is say they were there. It isn't about gangs. You need to get away from the idea that this is about targeting gangs. My 12 year-old son came home with a DVD from the Met Police saying, "Did you know that, if you are with someone and they commit an offence, you too can be convicted of it?" He's 12. Should that be what the police do? That is not education or keeping the peace; that is threatening them.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q78</strong> Elizabeth Truss: Ultimately, the jury will make the decision about whether that individual is culpable, and that will be a decision the legal advisers to those individuals take when they advise them whether or not to accept a plea bargain.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> In Laura Mitchell's case there was a 49-page route to verdict. The juries often come back to the judge to say, "We don't want to convict this person." They are very confused. They can see who is culpable and they do not want to do it. The judge will say, "No; it's a joint enterprise. You have to convict or acquit." We have several cases like that. The judge will tell the jury that it is a nod and a wink. Are you saying someone should be serving a life sentence because the judge told them a nod and a wink is enough? That is all it needs to establish that it is a joint enterprise and they knew what the other person was going to do.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q79</strong> Mr Buckland: Thank you for coming to give evidence. I have read the annexe to your submissions which relate to a number of accounts given by people who feel they have been wrongfully convicted of offences involving joint enterprise. Am I right in understanding—it is no criticism—that your research is based upon accounts given by individuals and their families who feel aggrieved because of convictions?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> No.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> I did not hear whether you said yes or no then.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> Yes or no to the answer?</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> You may have said something else. It is just that the acoustics are not very good. What was it that you said?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I am sorry. I need to say that we are only starting on research. You have been supplied with some examples. They did not come from me; I have not done those. As to the cases I see, I consider them researched when we have seen the evidence. In the end, our research will not depend on accounts given by people. We will go to them for explanations of things we do not understand in the evidence at that stage.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q80</strong> Mr Buckland: But at this stage in the cases you have presented to us, you have not been able to see the evidence in the case, either for the prosecution or the defence?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I do not know the cases. Personally, I could tell you for any particular case that I have seen or know about whether I have seen all or some of the evidence and I feel I know it adequately or not.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q81</strong> Mr Buckland: In any of the cases that you have been referring to directly or indirectly have you seen the totality of the evidence in the case?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I have not talked to you about any particular case yet.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q82</strong> Mr Buckland: I ask Ms Morrison as well. Some of the submissions made by prisoners were letters to you on behalf of the organisation you represent.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Yes.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q83</strong> Mr Buckland: Are you able to tell us whether you have seen the evidence in the cases?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> We have asked for the summing-up, but I have visited a lot of prisoners and families.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q84</strong> Mr Buckland: I understand and respect that, but it is the case, is it not, that you are giving evidence today on the basis of one side of the story? That is right, is it not?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Yes, but especially in murder cases we never underestimate the fact there are victims involved. Jean Taylor came to speak to our families, so we know what they are saying. Our statistics show that, at the moment, for every one murder, three people are prosecuted and in prison, so the statistics will cover up the fact that there are guilty people going free. Joint enterprise is not a level playing field at all. From the data we have collected—yes, it is one-sided—we are starting to see very clear common denominators about how people can be convicted under joint enterprise. It is about the evidential bar being lowered. It can be hearsay, which is very frightening.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q85</strong> Mr Buckland: With respect, how do you know that if you have had only one side of the story? With the greatest respect, you cannot say that on the basis of your research to date.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Then surely there should be research done.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I am sorry. I am the academic here and I do feel I should respond to that. I say again that we are only at the beginning of research. There are very few cases that we have researched to an adequate standard. We are only getting indicators of the type of evidence about which we are seriously worried. To understand cases, obviously, we look at the whole case; we look at the prosecution case and the evidence. Until we have done that, I do not think we can form an opinion. Gloria has just included those cases to give you the strength of feeling and distress and so on that many families express to us and to show why there is a powerful driving force behind us. We have 260 cases where people have come to us. Is it all right if I refer to a previous question about statistics and the preponderance of types of cases? There is an overwhelming number of murder cases; they are virtually all murder cases. I am surprised Keir Starmer was not aware of this. As to the matters we research—you have the latest figures—we take up every reference in the media to cases being prosecuted.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> There are 287 people currently charged with 87 murders. That is just murder convictions, but joint enterprise is used for ABH, GBH and burglary; it is used across the board.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q86</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Where do these statistics come from?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> It is a media trawl; that is all.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q87</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Explain to me what you mean by "a media trawl." You have just given quite a significant figure. If we are to use that as evidence, we need to know exactly where it has come from and on what basis it has been collected.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> In a sense, these are indicators. We may miss things that are in the media. Another member of our organisation regularly Googles, I suppose, for information online and assembles that into figures for us. It is only an indicator.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q88</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Have you any evidence of what happens on appeal in any of those cases?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> Relatively few go to appeal.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Both Andrew and I have sat in on appeals. They are heart-breaking. Often, on a joint enterprise, because there is so little evidence to convict you, you need fresh evidence so you cannot get an appeal. When you do get it, it is often based on whether the judge gave a clear direction to the jury on intent or foresight. The judges do not want to say they have made a mistake, even though it is glaringly obvious that a lot of these people should not be in prison. It is absolutely glaringly obvious.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q89</strong> Mr Buckland: How do you know that?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Would you allow a 15-year-old blind boy to go to prison for something he could not see?</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q90</strong> Mr Buckland: Are you talking about what the evidence is, because I have not been involved in the case? The point is that you are making assertions that are not based upon a full analysis of the evidence. I am not criticising you; you are not in a position to do that because only those involved in the case can do that.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I think you are in a position to criticise us if that is what we are doing.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> I do not think that is the objective.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em>I am trying to say that we are not in a position to make these assertions as yet; we only have indicators about them. Our plea throughout is for more research.</p>

  <p><strong>Chair</strong> The Committee is not in the business of criticising your campaign at all; it is simply establishing the weight of the evidence before it and on what it is based. We have to do that with all sorts of witnesses who come before us, including Ministers and civil servants.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q91</strong> Ben Gummer: Aside from evidence and data, there is an issue of principle here in the cases you have cited in your annexe. It occurs in all matters of joint enterprise. Someone who turns up at a crime happens to be involved. Let's say they are not the principal in a murder. They have a number of options. They can join in that murder; they can stand by and do nothing; they can intervene and try to stop it; or they can go and tell the police. It seems to me that what is missing from your line of argument is how the law recognises the person who intervenes and who is clearly in a different moral position from the person who does nothing and, in one instance given here, says, "I was merely a witness to this crime." Now "merely a witness to this crime" is a different degree of culpability, or non-culpability, from a case where someone actively goes in and tries to stop the crime happening. I am a bit concerned that, if we follow your line of argument, we are losing the ability to support the person who does the right thing rather than just does nothing.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> Our concern is with people who are innocent. I think the legal position is that the person who does nothing is not guilty of anything.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q92</strong> Chair: That is not necessarily the case if the person had foresight that his accomplice was going to do this.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> Then in a sense it is the point at which you become involved. If you are walking by and see something happen, you are not responsible for it. If you knew it was going to happen, I agree that you are in a different position. Our concern is with people where the court is told they have foresight on the basis of very tenuous evidence. We think that evidence is inadequate. Our concern is about the evidence in such cases.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q93</strong> Mr Llwyd: It may be that the doctrine of joint enterprise is not quite as blunt a tool as you say it is. For example, several dozen of the students who occupied Harrods last year were charged with a joint enterprise offence and the prosecutions were discontinued. I just make that point in passing. I disagree with Ms Morrison about appeals. In my hand, I have a whole list of cases that have gone to the Court of Appeal and we are now awaiting a very important case before the Supreme Court such is the concern of the legal establishment about the position. To say that there are very few appeals is, I am afraid, utterly incorrect. It has been suggested that the abolition of joint enterprise would allow guilty parties to go free. Do you agree, and if so, why?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> It is a difficult question. I do not agree on the basis that people would not go free if cases were adequately investigated. Because cases can go to court so easily and be successfully prosecuted, the police neglect to do anything else in the case. They are succeeding by getting evidence of phone calls, shared car use or getting people to act as witnesses. Because they can do it that way, they do not go looking for DNA or whatever. If they investigated more thoroughly, they would be able to get prosecutions of the people precisely responsible rather than those who are caught up in it simply because they have made or received phone calls, or something like that.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q94</strong> Mr Llwyd: Is it right your contention is that a joint enterprise prosecution is the subject of a less stringent investigative process?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I think so. Certainly, I am not alone in saying that the bar to prosecution is set very low. I think someone on the Committee and numerous eminent lawyers have said it. There are a number of quotations on that subject. Everyone agrees it is much easier to get a prosecution using joint enterprise rather than prosecution of an actual perpetrator.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> We do address the idea of the wall of silence. Real gang members will know that you do not say anything; you do keep the wall of silence, whereas often the families we are supporting are people who have done the right thing. They have told the police everything they know and have given themselves up to the police; they have witnessed something and gone in; they have tried to do what they think is the right thing and tell the truth, and they have received sentences under joint enterprise. What is the right thing to do is a very murky area. I go around and talk to young people and ask whether they know about joint enterprise. Many young people do not. They say, "What do we do if we are in a situation where somebody else is there?" I do not know what to tell them.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q95</strong> Mr Llwyd: When I was a youngster my father, who was a police sergeant, said that if any trouble broke out I should go away from it. That is a good line, is it not?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> Yes, but that is not necessarily going to be enough.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q96</strong> Mr Llwyd: Are you saying that you want to do away with this 300-year-old law altogether?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> We would like to know how many people have been convicted under joint enterprise. If you have a law being used as sweepingly as joint enterprise, surely you should be able to quantify or qualify how effective it is.</p>

  <p><strong>Mr Llwyd</strong> Yes.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> At the moment, nobody has any data or statistics. All we have are the families who have contacted us. We are in a very frightening situation where nobody can tell us how many people are currently serving sentences. There are people who have served over 30 years because they maintain their innocence, which is another area of this. If you are convicted under joint enterprise and you will not admit to being guilty of an offence, that means you are a denier. If you maintain your innocence, you will serve a lot longer than the person who has committed the offence.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q97</strong> Chair: How do you deal with a situation where two people are present in a closed room and a very serious assault is committed against a third person? It is not clear who delivers the most serious blow and neither will explain his actions or that of the other. If one of the persons is not guilty, he can give appropriate evidence or argue in his own defence that he has not done anything, but the two remain silent so as not to incriminate themselves.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> We have had cases that match exactly what you say. I do not think it has ever become clear in the couple of cases that have come to us. It did not become clear in court. There was one particular case where a jury apparently asked whether they could convict one and not the other, and the judge said, "No; you convict neither or both." In those cases that is the standard advice judges give to juries, but that is a small minority of the cases we deal with; normally, they involve more defendants.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q98</strong> Mr Llwyd: Are you saying that we need greater clarity and statistics to show how often these cases come up?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I would ask for the statistics to be compiled. I think it would be possible for the CPS to do it. I would like the opportunity to ask Keir Starmer whether he could do it. He could simply ask all his prosecutors—he could send them an e-mail—how many cases involving joint enterprise they had prosecuted in the last year. At least we would have some statistics. But we are more interested in evaluating what kind of evidence is used in what cases, and, hopefully, whether it was reasonable for inferences to be drawn from tenuous evidence. I do not know how many of those there are and what they are like. Those are the cases that come to our attention. Are they typical or not? I do not know. That is what we would like to research.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q99</strong> Mr Llwyd: This brings me back to Mr Buckland's point. In doing this work, you must ensure that you have both sides of the story and the full case from both perspectives.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> Yes. There is no point in our doing research on any other basis. It is not valid and we will not help people if in cases we neglect a prosecution point. We invalidate what we do.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q100</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: In the research you have done so far what recommendations would you make about altering the law of joint enterprise? You mentioned the way that in your view the police do not pursue any forensic evidence once they have established that an individual was present at the scene of a crime. Do you have any thoughts on what you would suggest?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I am sorry.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q101</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: If you were doing an investigation as we are into joint enterprise—you have obviously thought about it a great deal—what sort of change would you want to see in the law?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I should say, first, that I am not a lawyer; I am a criminologist.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q102</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Neither am I. In this Committee it is all right not to be a lawyer. Some of us are not lawyers; I am not a lawyer.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> I preface my remarks by saying I am not a lawyer because I do not know how to frame law in practice. We are concerned with the evidence. I do not know how to put into statute that you should be careful about evidence. If we look back over the last 20 years, evidence relating to mobile phones, which is a particular concern of ours, has now come into use. They were not available previously. It is now very widely used. I do not feel that you can make a universal law about types of evidence or anything like that. The situation changes and types of evidence come and go. I do not know how to frame it. But our concern about evidence, if we are right about it, needs to be fixed in a definite way so that it cannot be ignored in cases where juries draw unwarranted inferences, which are open to the introduction of prejudice on the part of people who think it is up to them to judge the person in the dock by the colour of his skin or whatever. I feel that the whole situation is open to that, and perhaps it explains why, as a rough estimate, 60% of our cases involve ethnic minorities.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q103</strong> Jeremy Corbyn: Technology has moved on a great deal and it is now much easier than 10, 15, 20, and certainly 30 years ago, to identify who was in what place at what time. Recording mobile phone calls is very easy; identifying the location of a mobile phone is not difficult. CCTV records where people are in a lot of urban locations, as does CCTV on buses, trains and so on. It is easy to prove that someone was there. My concern, and probably yours, is whether the collection of evidence of presence is simply being used to remove any requirement for any further evidence in your experience.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> In our experience, some of the evidence is not as definite as you suggest. To identify someone's position is not that precise. Sometimes it is very precise and sometimes not, and experts still argue about this extensively. Your second point was that people are convicted on evidence of presence. On the basis of a few cases I have seen where people claim that has happened to them—I have looked at the evidence extensively—that seems to have happened in my opinion. I feel that these cases are extremely doubtful and it is happening because juries can draw all the necessary inferences from presence at the scene, if they wish to do so.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Gloria Morrison</strong></em> We can provide the Committee with current data on trials or convictions.</p>

  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> That would be very helpful. I understand some of this from what is going on in my own community, but there is a lack of evidence of what happens on appeal, and the timing and length of appeals. I have heard of cases where people are trying to get retrials or appeals; they are in prison for a very long time, and justice delayed is justice denied. Therefore, any further robust evidence that you can offer would be very helpful.</p>

  <p><strong class="label label-info">Q104</strong> Chair: Dr Green and Ms Morrison, thank you very much. We are very grateful to you for coming this morning and giving evidence to us.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Dr Green</strong></em> Thank you for hearing us.
